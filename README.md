Neapol
======

An experiment to see what a subtitle editor implemented with modern
Python 3 and GTK 4 would look like. It doesn't actually work as an
editor, but you can view a subtitle file.

```bash
bin/neapol /path/to/subtitle.srt
```

If you like it, consider forking the code and adding the missing pieces.

If you just need something that works, try
[Gaupol](https://github.com/otsaloma/gaupol).
